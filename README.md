This is a mini python project for various client-server communication.

1. echo_server: this shows a simple server that returns or 'echoes' whatever the client/user input.
  - To complete the program, a new file must be created named "private.py" (under the same directory of server.py and client.py).
  - store here the same IP_address of the server (in string format) with the name 'SERVER_HOST' (this will be imported and refered by client.py)

2. chatroom (to be added in the future): this is a server that runs in multi-client. The various users can 'chat' and send messages that can be seen by everyone in the server
  
3. priority_client (to be added in the future): this is a multi-client server that implements a priority queue
